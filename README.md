# Code Challenge
Reading code is harder than writing it. The real world does not always have familiar coding conventions. You may even encounter an algorithm written in an unfamiliar language. At times, you may find code you have written last week incomprehensible. In this workshop, we will challenge your ability to read and understand a few selected examples of code.

### Structure
- Block of code displayed in web browser
- Input assumptions, i.e. known variables, database tables, etc. (seeded)
- Field for expected result

### Examples
- 10- questions
    - Languages mostly Java, Javascript, SQL, Python
    - Stretch challenges: Perl, Lisp, Haskell, Assembly?, GO?, Erlang/Elixir?, C?
    - Mix of difficulty
