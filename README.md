# Code Challenge
Reading code is harder than writing it. The real world does not always have familiar coding conventions. You may even encounter an algorithm written in an unfamiliar language. At times, you may find code you have written last week incomprehensible. In this workshop, we will challenge your ability to read and understand a few selected examples of code.

### Structure
- Block of code displayed in web browser
- Input assumptions, i.e. known variables, database tables, etc. (seeded)
- Field for expected result

### Examples
- 10 questions
    - Languages mostly Java, Javascript, SQL, Python
    - Stretch challenges: Perl, Lisp, Haskell, Assembly?, GO?, Erlang/Elixir?, C?
    - Mix of difficulty

### TODO:
 - Web App (ktor)
    - Create app with login
    - Create page for displaying code/input parameters and accepting answers
    - Security prevent users from cheating (logging in as other groups, opening multiple windows/tabs, copy from page)
 - Scoring Scheme
    - Penalties for wrong answers
    - Weighted for difficulty (automatically)
    - Scoreboard
 - Writing questions
